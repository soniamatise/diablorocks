		<h3>Part of you ride</h3>
		<p>Matise was asked to develop an online concept that would translate BBB’s vision. Simultaneously preserving the brand’s rich heritage and community, whilst also repositioning BBB’s modern vision on cycling. We developed a concept that allows BBB to present
			its products, without losing touch of the what a sunset ride in late spring feels like. In this way visitors may inform themselves about the specs on a helmet, while feeling the thrill of crossing down a hill.</p>
